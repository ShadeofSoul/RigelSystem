Before there were races to claim his rule a tyranny on the Earth, before there were minds to comprehend itâ€™s immaculate form, Khet was the mindless ruler. A force before there were those to bring force upon, a god when the Earth was godless and un-formed. Unthinking and inerrable as the constants of the natural world are, Khet was Fire and Movement and Collision, unstoppable as Fate itself. Its whims held no reason, its machinations clean of insight such as the New Gods would come to possess. Only for the greater Force of Change, the Unspoken Cromm, were his purposes doused, and his ceaseless form subdued by a greying World.",

I truly could not ask for a more awesome community! I hope this beasty is ample thanks to each and every one of ya! On a slightly sadder note, these coming summer months are likely the last I'll be able to keep creating on Spore. I'm starting college in August and looking ahead to a fun but very busy education in game design and animation...so who knows, ya might see me again sometime in a different game ;D I'll still be here up untill the latter days of July, and if I'm lucky I might get a creation published every once in a while during the schoolyear. I don't want to completely abandon this game, so I will sincerely try to be active as much as time and studying allows. You all have made this year an amazing one, and I hope I get to stay around for as long as possible. Thank you all very much",
